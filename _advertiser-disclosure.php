            <p>We believe everyone should be able to make healthcare decisions with confidence, so we strive to show you treatment options that are trustworthy, affordable, and most importantly, available from home. And while our site doesn’t feature every provider or treatment available, we’re proud that the information we offer and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward — and free for all to use.</p>
            <p>So how do we run this site? Some of the companies listed here compensate us because they also believe in transparent research to help consumers make informed decisions. This may influence which products we review and write about (and how/where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or opinions, which are developed based on thousands of hours of independent research. <span>Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. </span></p>
